        <p>
            Welcome to TrendsPlus ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application, TrendsPlus (the "App").

        </p>

        <h3>a) Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
        <p>
            We <strong>do not collect</strong> any Personally Identifiable Information from you. This includes your name, email address, phone number, or physical address. The App does not require you to create an account or log in.
        </p>

        <h3>b) Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</h3>
        <p>
            To improve the performance, stability, and user experience of our App, we may collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable information, such as:

        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Data Sources</h2>
        <p>
            The App's core functionality is to display publicly available trending content from third-party services. We do not control the data provided by these sources. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies:

        <h2>4. Advertisements</h2>

        </p>
        <p>
            In the future, we may integrate third-party advertising networks, such as Google AdMob. These networks may collect and use information to provide personalized advertising.

        <p>
            This App is not intended for or directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will immediately delete this from our servers.
